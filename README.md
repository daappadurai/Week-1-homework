# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to help Loiuse raise a target goal/fund of $10,000 for her play "Fever". Based on the crowdfunding data, the success rate based on location, timing and target fund amount were determined. This analysis looks into the top three destinations where she can host her fundraiser. The possible time of the year that she could plan her fundraiser and finally the likehood of getting her play funded given her target funding amount and if necessary adjust her funding goals.



## Analysis
### Top 3 destinations for hosting fundraiser for plays


The first analysis determined the probable location for her fundraiser. Upon analyzing total number of successful fundraisers based on country, the top three destinations were
1. US with 412 successful events
2. GB with 238 successful events
3. CA with 22 successful events


![By country](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116985403/201022854-3d5d108d-68c0-49cc-8eee-e355f20edf54.png)

However upon analyzing these destinations for Success and failure rate for fundraisers it changed the ranking as follows.

1. GB with a success rate of 75% and failure rate of 22%
2. CA with a success rate of 73% and a failure rate of 26%
3. US with a success rate of 61% and a failure rate of 37%

Based on this analysis, the likely destination for hosting the fundraiser can be either US or GB. US though the success rate is lower than the other two, the number of events hosted are roughly twice than all the other successful events from GB and CA put together. GB can be the second preferred destination, because it has a higher success rate and can be a popular destination for Play fundraiser. 

### Outcomes based on Launch Date


The next analysis was based on the launch date of the fund raiser and the likelihood of success. Upon sorting for successful outcomes based on launch dates under the "Theater category", the probable timing for fundraiser is May with a likihood of success of 67% and second best timing is June with a liklihood of success of 65% the third best timings are in the months of Feb, April and July with a likilihood of success of 63%.

Based on the top three destination, the timing of fundraiser based on (liklihood of success) is slightly different for the subcategory of plays.

1. For the US, the top 3 months for fund raiser is May, Jan and Novemebr (68%)
2. For GB, the top  months for fundraiser are Nov (88%), Aug, Sep and July (85%) 
3. For CA, the top months for fundraiser are Jan, March, April and Sep (100%)

### Outcome based on Goals
The final analysis was done to determine the target amount (goal) that will result in a higher liklihood of success. The successful fund raising events were sorted based on different target ranges starting from upto a 1000 or less, and incrementing a range of $5000 until $50,000 and grouping all successful events higher than $50,000 fundraiser amount.

Based on the analysis the top 6 goal targets based on hosting successful events are

1. Less than $1000 with the success rate of 76% with a total of 141 sucessful events
2. $1000-$4999 with a success rate of 73% with a total of 388 sucessful events.
3. $35,000-$39,999 with a success rate of 67% with a total of 4 successful events.
4. $40,000-$44,999 with a success rate of 67% with a total of 2 successful events.
5. $5000-$9,999 with a success rate of 55% with a total of 93 sucessful events.
6. $10,000-$14,999 with a success rate of 54% with a total of 39 sucessful events.
 

Based on the analysis it is evident that the success of a fundraiser is inverserly correlated to the funding amount. Based on Louise's goal of $10,000, she could either decide to host two fundraisers for the goal of $5000 or she could host one fundraiser with the target amount of $10,000. Though hosting two fundraisers may seem tedious, based on the analysis, it is evident that more successful fund raisers (388 events) belong to $1000-$4999 target amount.
 
### Recommendation for Louise to host her fundraiser

The analysis was done to help Louise raise $10,000 for her play "Fever"

The analysis proposes the following recommendation for Louise's play fundraiser

1. Two fundraisers ($5,000) hosted in the US in the months of Jan, May or Nov
2. One fundraiser ($10,000) hosted in the US in the months Jan, May or Nov
3. Two fundraisers ($5,000) hosted in the GB in the months July-Sep and Nov
4. One fundraiser ($10,000) hosted in the GB in teh months July-Sep and Nov
5. Two fundraisers one in the US ($5,000) in the months Jan, May or Nov and one in GB ($5,000) in the months July-Sep and Nov




## Results
### Conclusions based on Theater Outcomes by Launch date
1. People enjoy Theater fundraising events mostly in the Summer (May-July)
2. Rate of failure seems to be fairly constant with most months close to the average failure rate of 37%
### Conclusion based on Outcomes based on Goals
The success rate is inversely correlated to the fundraising goal.
### Limitations of the dataset
For the most part the data was informative to decide on the destination, time and funding amount,however a useful addition will be to incorporate the total cost of hosting the fundraising. With the cost of fundraiser in place, it will help to narrow down the locations especially when considering an overseas location. Human resources, venue and technological requirements may be additional factors that can be considered and plotting Cost/benefit ratio can be very useful.
